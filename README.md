# Task-Shelv-Manager

i came up with two solutions for task.

first one "task2"
and the second one "Robot_Interface_ShelvesWithWeights"

Task is as follow: 

Shelf System (7x6, 42 slots):
Each part has a string ID and is either light or heavy.
Operations:
-Get/store next free space (respecting: heavy bottom, light top).
-Get/remove next occupied space (FIFO).
-Get/remove part by ID.
-Put/remove part at specific position (regardless of status).
